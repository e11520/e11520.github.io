观天象而授人时，日月的位置 ，地球的自转，人在地球上的经纬，决定了时间。

所谓得其位得其时，所谓生辰星座八字，都最终回溯到了天文。

时间，连接了历法置闰、易学象数、五行干支、二十八宿。

以本篇为第一篇，万物归一，生生不息。

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.
